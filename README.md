# internship-bot

Tool that scrapes Internships.com to help individuals discover internship opportunities in geographical areas and fields of their choice. It utilizes the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to discover recent postings online. I developed this as part of my final project for my Post-AP Data Structures high school course.

Instructions to use:
1. First install dependencies using "pip install -r requirements.txt".
2. Run internships.py.
